Clinical trials have shown that viewing smiling babies improves mental and physical well-being (especially among females). Our website exploits this phenomenon and provides users with their daily-dose of Vitamin CB (Cute Babies) that they need to remain happy and healthy. We have an abundant supply of Vitamin CB and would like to share it with as many people as possible. Whether you have a few minutes or a life-time we are confident that you will be glad you visited. Also, every time you cast a vote on Baby-Vote we make a charitable donation. We are going to help you improve the world, one click at a time. A portion of all of our proceeds is allocated to help feed starving children in third world countries. Nearly 97% of the population of Tanzania lives on less than $2 a day. We are doing what we can to help reduce starvation and improve the world."  -->
